# YOLO-game
A simple game of speed and wit. During the  Covid-19 pandemic, we were ordered to stay at home. My friends and I were playing a game of Yell Out Loud, when I suggested instead of using the cards (which required a Card master), what if we create a simple program for this game, so all three of us could enjoy. Using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we created this game.
