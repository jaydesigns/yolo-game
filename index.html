            This is a game of speed and wit! You can play this game with your friends or family. You need at least two people for this game. You can play 1-on-1, or if you're with a group, divide the group into two. 
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The game is simple, you just have to yell out loud the word or phrase that starts with the given letter according to the chosen topic. The person or group who yells out loud the correct word or phrase FIRST gets the point.
